This package is used to store the preview server, it is also published and versioned so that it can be installed when the [CLI](../useprint) is being used.

## Development workflow

### 1. Seed document templates

```sh
pnpm dev:seed
```

This generates a boilerplate documents directory for you to work with. These files can also be modified as you see fit since they are not included in git.

### 2. Run development server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This is somewhat equivalent to `next dev` and does not support hot reloading for document templates like the CLI does. It lets you work on the UI for the preview server mainly.

### 3. Open in your browser

Go to http://localhost:3000
